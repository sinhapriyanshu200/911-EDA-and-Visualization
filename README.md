1. 911 Calls Data Analysis

This is a data exploration and visualization project analyzing 911 emergency call data. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights such as when and where emergency calls are made most frequently, and the common reasons behind them.

---

2. Dataset

The dataset includes:
- **Timestamp** of each call
- **Reason/Title** of the emergency
- **Geolocation** (latitude, longitude)
- **Zipcode** and **Township**

---

3. Objectives

- Understand the distribution of 911 calls by type (EMS, Fire, Traffic).
- Visualize call trends by hour, day, and month.
- Use heatmaps to explore patterns in time (day of week vs hour).
- Plot geographic distribution of call locations.

---

4. Key Findings

- EMS is the most common reason for calls, followed by Traffic and Fire.
- Call volume peaks during the afternoon and early evening.
- Weekdays see higher traffic-related calls, while fire calls are more evenly spread.
- Latitude-longitude scatter plots reveal regional hotspots for emergency calls.

5. Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
